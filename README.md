# eWallet Application - Microservices Architecture

## Project Overview

**GlobalPay eWallet** is a comprehensive digital wallet application transforming from a monolithic architecture to a modern, scalable microservices-based system deployed on Alibaba Cloud. This project addresses the need for enhanced scalability, improved maintainability, and robust performance to handle high-volume financial transactions.

### Key Objectives

- **Scalability**: Support 100,000+ daily transactions with peak load handling
- **Modernization**: Transform monolithic system to microservices architecture
- **Performance**: Achieve sub-200ms response times for critical operations
- **Security**: Implement enterprise-grade security and compliance frameworks
- **Zero-Downtime Migration**: Ensure business continuity during transformation

## Architecture Overview

### Current State
- **Monolithic Java Spring Framework** application
- **Single MySQL database**
- **Tightly coupled modules** (user management, account balances, transfers)
- **Scalability limitations** during peak times

### Target State
- **8 Independent Microservices** with dedicated databases
- **Event-driven architecture** with message queues
- **Container orchestration** with Kubernetes (ACK)
- **Multi-layer caching** with Redis cluster
- **Comprehensive monitoring** and observability
